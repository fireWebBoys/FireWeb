In terms of design, how would you like the site to be designed?
Its educational so keep that in mind, an official feel to it but ideally would like a prototype to show design.

Is there any inspiration from websites you like?
No but soft colours and pastel colours are preferable, not vivid colours like red or black, maybe look at other educational sites to see how they are laid out, would like images such as someone playing an instrument.

In terms of reliability of the website, is there any special request for up time, 24/7 etc..?
What do we think about it … When we were students what did we think about our college website, we should keep it up full time.

Is there any other specific requests such as the searchbar etc..
No idea it is completely up to us, free range of design, easy to read, attractive site , just not vivid colours.

In terms of the teachers area section, would you like it like facebooks feed where it can be seen the students or more specific such as courses or specific students?
Would like consistency throughout such as sidebars footers etc..

In terms of the teachers area, what would you like to be able to be added?
Maybe a YouTube could be added, document on best practices for teaching or the 2021 syllabus, could be documents or youtube videos, it’s a view area and the teachers are not adding comments, not a feed.
